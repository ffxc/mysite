		<h1> All About Polar Bears </h1>

		 <h2> <u>Introduction</u> </h2> 
		<p> The polar bear is a large and carnovous bear. They live within the Artic Circle. The polar bear is a large bear and is about the same size as the Kodiak Bear.
		    The adult male polar bear weighs around 772-1,543. The adult female polar bear weighs about half of the adult male. The polar bear has black skin under its' white fur. 
			Polar bears are very fast and strong and they can run up to 25 miles an hour for a short distance. They are also very strong swimmers.
			The polar bear is classified as a vulnerable sppiece because of its' expected habitat loss because of climate change.

	    <h2> <u>Artic Adjustments</u></h2>
		<p>Polar bears live on one of the coldest environments and they depend on their thick coat of fur to keep them warm. 
		Fur even grows on the bottom of the polar bears paws. The protects them against cold sufaces and gives them good grip on the ice.

		<h2> <u>Habitat </u></h2>
		<div id= "secondparagraph">
		
		<p> The polar bear lives in the Artic Circle. The polar bear is a marine animal becase it spends many months at sea. however, it is the only marine animal that has large, powerful limbs and feet
			that allow the to cover miles on feet and run on land.  The polar bear's preferred habitat is the  sea ice that is covering the waters over the continental shelf and the Arctic archipelagos. 
			These places, known as the "Arctic ring of life".The polar bear tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water.

		<h2><u>Hunting and Diet </u></h3>
		
		<p> The polar bear is the most carnivorous member of the bear family. The polar bear's diet usally consists of ringed and bearded seals and fish.. 
		The artic is home to many of seals, but once they surface up to breath or when they go out on the ice to rest they become prey. 
		Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water. 
		The polar bear's most common hunting method is called still-hunting.	
		The bear uses its excellent sense of smell to figue out where the seal's breathing hole is. 
		Once the polar bear located where the seal's breathing hole is, the bear crouches nearby in silence and waits for a seal to appear. the bear could be waiting for a few hours or it could be wating for a few minutes.
		Once the seal exhales, the polar bear smells it's breath and reaches into the whole with it's forepaw and drags the seal up onto the ice. The polar bear kills the seal by bitting its head. By doing that the polar bear crushes the seals skull. 
		Mature bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, which are highly digestible. But, the younger bears, eat the protein-rich red meat of the prey.
		Subadult bears are independent of their mother but they are not big enough and they don't have enough experience to sucessfully hunt seals.
		Subadult may eat remains from other bears' kills, which is an important source of their nutrition. 
		Subadults may also be forced to eat a half-eaten carcass if they kill a seal but they can't defend it from bigger bears.
		After feeding, polar bears wash themselves with water or snow.

		<h2> Polar Bear Cubs</h2>
		<p> Polar bear cubs are born in the shelter of their mother's den. The mother normally digs the den with her front and hind paws in snowdrifts 
		or snow covered hills near the coast or in snow ridges. The dens provide the cubs protection from the wind, cold, and predators. The most common predators are Artic Foxes and other polar bears especially male ones.
		The den is warmer than the outside. Polar bear cubs spend the majority of their early childhood in the den to stay warm and to also bond with their mother. 
		A newborn baby is ready to eat solid food in just a few months. They grow their own fur within approximately 8 to 10 weeks, but it can take up to 14 weeks. 
		The pups begin to resemble their mother and will soon copy her habits. After about 3 or 4 months the mother takes the polar bear cubs venture outside the den with their mother. They 
		The pups learn hunting and survival skills from their mother. The cubs stay close to their mother and follow her around. Once the mother lets her cubs go in the water, they get used to it and become good swimmers.
		The mother teaches the cubs how to stalk prey. The baby polar bears follow their mother and observe their mother while she is hunting.
